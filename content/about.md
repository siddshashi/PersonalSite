I'm an undergrad studying [EECS][eecs] and [French][ucbfrench] at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in developing tools to bridge communication gaps and transfer ideas, particularly through multimodal models and LLM inference. 

Last fall, I worked at a stealth robotics startup, where I built a ultra-low latency ranging system for drone flybys. Before that, I spent time writing software at [Rivian][rivian] and conducting ML research at [BAIR][bair]. I also built software and hardware for autonomous formula-style electric race cars at [Formula Electric at Berkeley][feb]. 

I enjoy emails, feel free to contribute to this enjoyment via sshashi [at] berkeley [dot] edu.
