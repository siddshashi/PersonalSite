Using convolutional, downsampling, and upsampling blocks in a UNet, I built a denoiser for handwritten digits. For the denoising process, I incorporated timestep conditioning using fully connected layers to iteratively denoise images over 20 epochs. I then extended the UNet with class-conditioning and classifier-free guidance, enabling flexible and accurate generation. [GitHub][ghlink]
